<h1> Why is Terrorism a Problem in Todays Society?</h1>
<p> Since the mid-1900's formal terrorism has been on a steady, and dangerous, rise. When
terrorism first appeared in the 1960's in the Middle East, the U.N only treated it as a local issue. 
Foundations were made laid for Al Qaeda's September 11th attack by Palestinian terrorists on July 1968
by hijackers. Terrorist hijackers also made a series of attacks in flight in the 1970's, 
and murdered 11 athletes in the attack of the Munich Olympics. This is not including the 
recent terror attacks in New York, Paris, Brussels (etc.) Not only has terrorism remained
a constant and major threat to world peace, disrupting agreements with various nations,
but it has also threatened the lives of individuals who want nothing more than 
a peaceful life of contentment. Furthermore, the people affected by terrorism, are not 
simply the ones abroad (countries other than those of the Middle East), but those people 
who, are of the same decent and nationality as the terrorist attackers, yet who are not 
Muslim nor share the same beliefs, are also criticized, tortured, and put to death. The 
methods, however, used by terrorists to get their point across to the outside world, is 
inhumane, unthinkable, and immoral, on an entirely new level, so I will refrain from 
mentioning their every detail in depth. However, the fact remains that terrorism is a threat
unlike any other that our modern world has experienced before and must be addressed, in order
to be resolved.
