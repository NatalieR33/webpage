<h1> Why is Terrorism a Problem in Todays Society?</h1>
<p> Since the mid-1900's formal terrorism has been on a steady, and dangerous, rise. When
terrorism first appeared in the 1960's in the Middle East, the U.N only treated it as a local issue. 
Foundations were made laid for Al Qaeda's September 11th attack by Palestinian terrorists on July 1968
by hijackers. Terrorist hijackers also made a series of attacks in flight in the 1970's, 
and murdered 11 athletes in the attack of the Munich Olympics. This is not including the 
recent terror attacks in New York, Paris, Brussels (etc.) Not only has terrorism remained
a constant and major threat to world peace, disrupting agreements with various nations,
but it has also threatened the lives of individuals who want nothing more than 
a peaceful life of contentment. Furthermore, the people affected by terrorism, are not 
simply the ones abroad (countries other than those of the Middle East), but those people 
who, are of the same decent and nationality as the terrorist attackers, yet who are not 
Muslim nor share the same beliefs, are also criticized, tortured, and put to death. The 
methods, however, used by terrorists to get their point across to the outside world, is 
inhumane, unthinkable, and immoral, on an entirely new level, so I will refrain from 
mentioning their every detail in depth. However, the fact remains that terrorism is a threat
unlike any other that our modern world has experienced before and must be addressed, in order
to be resolved.

<h1> How is Terrorism Affecting People on a Larger Scale? </h1>
<p> People are affected by terrorism more than one may know. Econonically, countries are complying 
 with them, in a sense, by spending money on warfare, etc., instead of putting that money in places which it would
 be most effective, especially to their own citizens. Of course, this aspect is hardly noticeable. But, it is, nonetheless
 present. Socially, it is dividing up citizens, families, and friends. Furhering this aspect, not only are they divided, 
 but, most times, forever, and it is ended in a most drastic way. Terrorism is a threat to world peace. But, in 
 a more important sense, it is a threat to family peace, homeland peace, and brotherly love.

<h1> What Can be Done? </h1>
<p> Ofcourse, individuals, in themselves, can do their part by protecting their homelands (native country), and encourging
 love and respect among all. The actions of others can sometimes be changed/altered through example. As a country, however,
 we must do what we can, together. This group has not ever been a large group of people, and, in the beginning, could have been 
 put down immediately. Now that it has been given time to grow and become stronger, countires must unite and do what the U.N. 
 has the right to do; maintain peace. Thus far, that has not been accomplished. All in all, individuals must come together, people 
 must come together, and countries must come together. We are ALWAYS stronger together, than we are apart.
