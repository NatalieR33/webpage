<h1> The Importance of Computer Science </h1>
<p> Before anyone can so much as consider getting involved, staying connected, or keeping
informed, in our ever-growing electronic world, he must first educate himself on the 
basis of computers. It is important to realize that "computers" include a vast majority of 
devices and range from the smallest mechanisms of kitchen equipment, to extensively 
complex drones that hover within our atmosphere. Without the understanding of computers, 
or how they operate, it is questionable whether or not all of the lands that we know,
today, would yet be discovered. Or, whether automobiles would be used to mans leisure. 
If airplanes would yet carry people around the world in just hours, or, even, if we would
have progressed out of the age of scrolls, scripts, and letters. Thus, with advancements 
in computers, come advancements in communication, interaction, and industrialization, and,
with that, one can use his resources to change the world, be it on a small or large scale.
As for me, I will use mine to address a main, worldwide issue that has affected thousands 
of people, progressively, since the late 20th century.

<h1> What I Have Learned </h1>
<p> This Computer Science class has been centered around a steady progression, through  
small steps, leading up to creating ones own website. The class has been through the realm 
of code, documents (such as HTML), varying style sheets, table format and how to input 
info., image and link uploads, etc. I have learned just how important knowledge of 
computers, in even the smallest scale, is in our century of progression and development. I
have come to realize that, though the aspects of the course are complicated and complex, 
in themselves, when you take them in small segments, and one at a time, they are easily
understood. Computer taught me more than technical knowledge. It taught me
