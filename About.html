<h1> Education </h1>
<p> Leading up to Covina High, I have been through the public, private, and home-school 
systems, all of which taught me crucial life skills, and helped me grow in insurmountable
intellectual strength. I was raised, for the most part, with a strongly Catholic-based
education. My educational strengths include, English, Grammar, and Literature (from which 
I received a certificate of Honors.) I have always been able to maintain an average, to 
slightly above, in my Math and Science courses, yet was able to master Art (even though
I'm not musically inclined when it comes to playing musical instruments.) At Covina, I 
am currently taking Leadership, and it has become a very helpful, and memorable, aspect 
for me here. One which I will take with me for the rest of my life. </p>

<h1> Future Educational/Career Goals </h1>
<p> As my studies in various places and organizations have progressed, I have, through my
strengths and weaknesses, become aware of where I want to be in the future. After having 
been accepted into the Catholic colleges that I applied to, I decided to attend 
Christendom College for 2 years (Associates equivalent), and then transfer on to Notre 
Dame University in Illinois. I will major in Political Science, with a possible minor in
Communications and Public Speaking. It is an option that I will also do ROTC for the 
United States Air Force. It is also my goal to take internships in the nations capital; 
Washington, D.C. </p>

<h1> The Big Picture </h1>
<p> All in all, it is my goal to, not just make a difference, but to change the world. It  
is my goal to, not just appreciate the freedom I have, but to fight for it, myself. It is 
my goal to, not just be a citizen that speaks of reform, but is the one to go out and make
it. Therefore, through education, patience, and determination, it will become possible to 
do so. For me, I want to take all the skill and knowledge that I have received in my 13  
years of formal, and informal, education, and apply it to what I have the chance to make  
of myself, and do so through the path of Government and Politics. </p>
